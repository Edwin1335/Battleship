#Battleship
Created by Edwin Campuzano

This project is beign currently being worked on. It was created on early april 2020, it 
is/will be a fully funtioning battle ship game, except there are some slight changes to the code 
compared to the traditional way of making a board game with grids. This game will not use a typical 
array grid, but rather a map of linked of nodes with infomation on each node. 
There is one pointer to access all the nodes (top right hand corner pointer) to traverse throught 
the grid.
